## About This App

This application allows you to generate pixel art character sprites in different classes (Warrior, Archer, Mage) with multiple animation states (Idle, Walking, Attacking, Defending, Dying). Each sprite is procedurally generated with randomized colors and features while maintaining a cohesive 16-bit retro game aesthetic.

4. Click "Generate Sprite" to create a new character
5. Adjust animation speed if desired
6. Use "Save Sprite" to export the animation frames as PNG files
